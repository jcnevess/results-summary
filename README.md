## My process

### Built with

- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Mobile-first workflow
- **Web components**

### What I learned

As a challenge, I used `web components` to tackle the creation of each section of the summary. It was hard...

I think Web components are a very powerful tool, but the module feels like a work in progress. It is a bit hard to do simple tasks using it, and it seems very error prone too. Maybe things would be easier if I used web components with templates. Well, I learnt something new.
